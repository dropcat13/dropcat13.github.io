            <p>My name is Catherine, friends and family call me Cat, but never Cathy!</p>
            <p>I come from Norwich, Norfolk, UK which is about 2 hours East of London (in the bumpy bit on the right hand side. It's a really nice place with medieval and Norman buildings. The surrounding area is very flat and very rural, but has lots of beaches.</p>
            <p>I studied bassoon and baroque bassoon at the Royal Northern College of Music and then spent some time working as a freelance bassoonist and teaching.
            <p>Now I live in the USA because of my husband's job moving us here. I'm still teaching music but I'm ready to try something new!</p>
